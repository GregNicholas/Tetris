# Tetris
Javascript Tetris like game
We are using vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS to build a tetris like game.
Simply run download all code and run the index.html file in the browser or 
check out the GitHub pages live link: https://gregnicholas.github.io/Tetris/

This is based on Ana Kub√≥w's basic tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1JJfK09ujQ
In my version, I've fixed many bugs and glitch behaviors, updated with a cool retro style, 
and packed the game with extra features including start/pause button, scores, levels, music, "hold" and
"up next" areas, enhanced controls with quick and instant drop.

Please play and enjoy the game, and if you have any questions, suggestions, or find a bug,
please let me know!

* Upon testing across multiple browsers and different machines, there were a few issues noted.
* Originally, css "outline" was used in the game area. This caused problems in firefox. Changed
* outlines to borders and adjusted positioning.
* One more issue found was when using on a chromebook, the tetrominoes fell in a diagonal 
* direction and broke up through the sides.

This project helped me improve JavaScript skills, mixing this interactivity in with html and css. 
Not a high priority project right now as I am busy with new projects and advancing skills, 
but with my currently much improved skills, I could definitely do some refactoring and make several 
improvements if I had time.
