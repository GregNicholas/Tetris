# Tetris
Javascript Tetris like game
We are using vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS to build a tetris like game.
Simply run download all code and run the index.html file in the browser or 
check out the GitHub pages live link: https://gregnicholas.github.io/Tetris/

This is based on Ana Kub√≥w's basic tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1JJfK09ujQ
In my version, I've fixed many bugs and glitch behaviors, updated with a cool retro style, 
and packed the game with extra features including start/pause button, scores, levels, music, "hold" and
"up next" areas, enhanced controls with quick and instant drop.

Please play and enjoy the game, and if you have any questions, suggestions, or find a bug,
please let me know!
